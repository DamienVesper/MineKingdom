My experience of management and general staffing started in 2015 when Minecraft was really getting popular. Since then I’ve had many jobs as management and have ventured over into freelancer discords and starting my own businesses with my partner.`)
        +card(2, `Matt`, `Hello! My name is Matt and I've been around the MC Community for quite some time now, and I love to develop and configure servers. More recently I have started taking a liking to the management and staff on MC servers. I live in Arizona, so yeah, it does get pretty hot over here. I really enjoy MC and I believe that I am good with that I do and I have the need to share it with others. I try my best to be professional when I need to be, but other times I prefer to hang with the members of any server because that's how they get to love the server even more.`)
